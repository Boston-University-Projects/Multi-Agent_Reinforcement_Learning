# Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning
 Goal: To get a job at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories and a publication for Master Thesis!

Note: Here are a list of Good Resource that will help me get into this field. Those resources covers 


## Plan Outline

- Chap1 -- Intro: 
  - history of RL(Reinforcement Leanring)
  - Current Application
  - Significance(covered in many papers)
  - and the promising futures
- Chap 2: Methodologies: 
  1.  Classical Algorithm and methods: and then we will have a quick overview of most classical and influential algorithms that people had invented in the past
  2. SOTA Algorithm: Following, we will dive into some current most popular algorithms or methods that people had used to produce those SOTA(State of the art) results.

- Chap 3: Application: 
  1. Realization of Algorithm : Then, we will dive into the detail of implementations, and try to apply those algorithms on certain senario and replicate their result. 

After having a solid understanding of the algorithms, and the capability to reproduce the result, it should be enough to make a story and showing them we have some experience and familiarity in this field, but might or might not be enough to fullfill the requirement of two JD(job description), CA1531: Learning-based multi-agent motion planning and DA1508: Safe reinforcement learning for real-life applications listed here, https://www.merl.com/internship/openings?ai=on&ml=on&ro=on.


> DA1508: Safe reinforcement learning for real-life applications, "The ideal candidate should have solid background in RL, e.g. CMDP, and RMDP theories. Knowledge of dynamical system theory and nonlinear control theory is a plus, but not a requirement. Publication of the results produced during the internship is anticipated, e.g., ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS."

==> "Solid Background" didn't not well defined, and they didn't explicitly mention the publication is a must.

> CA1531: Learning-based multi-agent motion planning, "The ideal candidate is enrolled in a PhD program in Electrical, Mechanical, Aerospace Engineering, Robotics, Computer Science or related program, with prior experience in multi-agent motion planning, machine learning (especially supervised, reinforcement, and safe ML), and convex and non-convex optimization. A successful internship will result in innovative methods for multiagent planning, in the development of well-documented (Python/MATLAB) code for validating the proposed methods, and in the submission of relevant results for publication in peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals."

==> They mentioned their expected result, "innovative methods for multiagent planning, in the development of well-documented (Python/MATLAB) code for validating the proposed methods, and in the submission of relevant results for publication in peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals" ==> But, they didn't explicitly mention the candidate must have publication in the field as well. 

==> I can see that a publication is sufficient for an "accepted", but not a necessity. I think they still want to open the possibility to those Master or Undergrad student who do not have publication, but being able to show some solid understand in those field. ==> So, I think that's my goal, being able to show my understanding. 


- Objective Category of this paper:
To show the understanding, I think I either should have a paper being published, or have a draft paper that is on the way of being published + some great demonstration of essential concept + some intriguing result/insight/analysis (So, a good interview will be critical!)

==> So, let's aiming the goal for publication as well. First, we need to decided the type of paper we want to publish (At least, we should give them a reason to accept our paper right?)

  1. Publication
  2. Improvement(TBD): Therefore, we need to push it further, to get a paper published at high-impact conferences/journals(high-impact conferences/journals (e.g., CoRL, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, UAI, RSS, ICRA, COLT, CDC, L4DC, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, PAMI, IJCV, etc.), and that will definitely will be enough to eliminate their concern. 

After some research, I found there are several type of publish



  3. There are two possibility I have in my mind in order to achieve this: 1) Origianl Invent a innocative algorithm that can be applied to certain field, and the result should be competitve to the current SOTA(not necessary outmatch them, but should outperform the traditional algorithm that invented in the past); 2) 
   1) A review paper? I heard some publication will accept some review paper, but I do not sure that boundary between "reject" and "accept", and I also do not sure if Chap2 will be enough for a Review paper. So I think
- SOTA(state of the art):
